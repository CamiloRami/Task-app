# Task app 
___
It is a simple task manager app built with create-react-app. 
It uses local storage to store the tasks, but it also uses a backend to store the user data.
Yoy can see the app in action [here](https://task-app-rho.vercel.app/).

## How to run the app
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the app

If you want to use a backend, you can use the one I made for this app [here](https://github.com/CamiloRami/Task-app-backend)
